**NOTE**: This project uses [Electron React Boilerplate](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/), built on Electron, React, Redux, React Router, Typescript, and Webpack. Go see their documentation for more information.

## Quickstart

Use `yarn dev` to get up and running.

Use `yarn package` to create a standalone executable application for your current system.

## Architectural Notes

`/app/` contains all the application code.

`/app/main.dev.ts` is the entry point for the electron application's main process

`/app/renderer/` contains all the traditionally "front-end" code: that is to say the renderer code

## To Do

- Look into publishing https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish
